- **Fonts:**
  - Add or swap custom fonts in the `fonts/` folder and update the `@font-face` rules in `style.css`.

  - Animations are handled via GSAP, AOS, and custom CSS. Adjust or add effects in `script.js` and `style.css`.

- **Contact Form:**
  - The form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for submissions. Update the `action` attribute in the form if you want to use a different service.
